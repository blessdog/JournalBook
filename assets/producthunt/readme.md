A truly private, offline-first, personal journal

## Description

JournalBook is a truly private, offline-first personal journal.

Your notes are **only** stored on your device, they're never even sent to a server. You don't even need to sign-in to use it! It works offline, so you can reflect upon your day on the slow train journey home.

There's no app to install, JournalBook is a progressive web app and runs entirely in the browser. You can even add it to your homescreen and it'll work as well as any other app on your phone.

Despite the lack of server or native app, JournalBook is still fully featured, with tools like data import/export, autosave, theming and much more. It's super-quick, lightweight, and developed in the open.
